How It Works
Input:

p_month: The month you want to analyze (e.g., 9 for September).

It then calculates the Attendance Percentage as:

Attendance Percentage = (Total Presents / Total Days in Month) * 100
Output:

Displays each employeeâ€™s name, total presents, total absents, and attendance percentage.
If no records are found for an employee, it shows a "No records" message.
